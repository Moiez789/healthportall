                        <p>Health,Fitness There’s no doubt that regular exercise is good for the mind and body. But a regular gym goer has a host of male organ problems that they’re more susceptible to than those sitting on the couch. Between less than sanitary conditions, communal bathrooms and lots of sweat, your typical gym is ripe with bacteria that can leave your manhood vulnerable to discomfort. But with a little knowledge, many of the most common male problems found at the gym are easily diagnosable and treatable. Here are the three most common male organ problems found at the gym and how you can solve them: 1) Yeast Infection - Most commonly thought of as a female health problem, men can also find themselves with a yeast infection, especially if they’re frequenting the gym. This type of infection is caused by a fungus called candida. While candida is usually present on the body and perfectly healthy, an overgrowth of it can be the cause of a male yeast infection. Symptoms of a male yeast infection typically includes itching and a burning sensation accompanied by a red rash or white, shiny patches on the member. In some cases, a thick white substance may be present. Candida thrives in dark, warm and moist conditions, making it essential to change out of sweaty gym clothes as soon as your exercise is over. Spending the day in used gym clothes can make one very susceptive to this common problem.</p>
