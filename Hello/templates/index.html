                            <p class="post-subtitle">Business Many Britons have a problematic relationship with drinking, according to a survey carried out by Google on behalf of Charterhouse Clinic Flore , The survey data showed that 21.3% of respondents admitted to drinking “more than seven units of alcohol” in a session. This puts them in the binge-drinking category, according to the NHS. One in 10 of us would like to cut down on our drinking and feel guilty about the amount that we do drink. One in 20 admitted to drinking to the point of memory loss. One in 20 have also been asked to stop drinking by a friend or family member. Drinking first thing in the morning to steady a hangover was the least common drinking problem, though six respondents admitted to this as well. Few people understood the limit for “low-risk” drinking, but there was an even split between those who underestimated and overestimated the limit. Just one in four knew that the recommended limit from the NHS for low-risk drinking is 14 units per week. Not all bad news There are a rising number of people who don’t drink at all in the UK. 35% of those surveyed said that they never drink. This is an increase compared to an ONS survey from 2016. The 2016 survey found that 21% of adults did not drink at all. 47% of women asked said that they never drink, whereas the figure for men was 23.3%. In total, more than half of adults reported not drinking regularly, either never drinking or just drinking on three or four occasions a month. </p>
